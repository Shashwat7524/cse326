        <h1><u>What is paintball game all about?</h1></u>
Paintball is a game that originated in America in the early eighties which involves teams or individual players competing 
<br>against each to eliminate other players by hitting them with paint-filled pellets fired from a compressed gas powered gun, 
otherwise known as a marker, and complete game objectives.
<br>The required equipment include Paintball mask, paintball marker, paint grenades, compressed air or CO2 container, paintballs and hopper.
 Body armor is optional but players should wear it while gaming outside in woods for safety reasons. 

<br>In paintball, players of both teams need to eliminate each other by tagging them with the capsules (paintballs) containing non-toxic and
 biodegradable water-soluble dye and featuring a gelatin outer shell. 
<br>These capsules are fired from the paintball marker/gun to hit the target. 
Different types of games are played with paintball including flag capturing, opponents elimination, ammunition limits, <br>capturing the objects of interest concealed in the playing area and defending/attacking a specific point or area.

Woodsball, MilSim (Military Simulation) and Speedball are the most commonly played paintball games in which players must wear protective masks.
