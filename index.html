<h1><u> Meaning and history of paint ballling</u></h1>
<p><i>All your electronics needs in one place a game in which participants simulate military combat using airguns to shoot capsules of paint at each other.....
Paintball is a competitive team shooting sport in which players eliminate opponents from play by hitting them with spherical
 dye-filled gelatin capsules called paintballs that break upon impact.
 Paintballs are usually shot using low-energy air weapons called paintball markers that are powered by compressed air (nitrogen) or
  carbon dioxide and were originally designed for remotely marking trees and cattle.
The game was invented in May 1981 in New Hampshire by Hayes Noel, a Wall Street stock trader, and Charles Gaines, an outdoorsman and 
writer.
 A debate arose between them about whether a city-dweller had the instinct to survive in the woods against a man who had spent his youth
  hunting, fishing, and building cabins. 
The two men chanced upon an advertisement for a paint gun in a farm catalogue and were inspired to use it to settle their argument with
 10 other men all in individual competition, eventually creating the sport of paintball.
The sport is played for recreation and is also played at a formal sporting level with organized competition that involves major 
tournaments, professional teams, and players.
 Paintball technology is also used by military forces, law enforcement, paramilitary, and security organizations to supplement military
  or other training.
Games can be played on indoor or outdoor fields of varying sizes. A playing field may have natural or artificial terrain which players 
use for tactical cover.
 Game types and goals vary, but include capture the flag, elimination, defending or attacking a particular point or area, or capturing
  objects of interest hidden in the playing area
Depending on the variant played, games can last from minutes to hours, or even days in "scenario play".
The legality of the sport and use of paintball markers varies among countries and regions.
 In most areas where regulated play is offered, players are required to wear protective masks, use barrel-blocking safety equipment, and
  strictly enforce safe game rules.</i></p>


<h1><u>how does paint balling working?</u></h1>
<P><i> is a game that originated in America in the early eighties which involves teams or individual players
 competing against each to eliminate other players by hitting them with paint-filled pellets fired from a compressed
 gas powered gun, otherwise known as a marker, and complete game objectives.
Paintball is played with a potentially limitless variety of rules and variations, which are specified before the game begins.
 The most basic game rule is that players must attempt to accomplish a goal without being shot and marked with a paintball.
  A variety of different rules govern the legality of a hit, ranging from "anything counts" (hits cause elimination whether the 
  paintball broke and left a mark or not) to the most common variation: the paintball must break and leave a mark the size of a
   US quarter or larger. Eliminated players are expected to leave the field of play; eliminations may also earn the opposing team points.
Depending on the agreed upon game rules, the player may return to the field and continue playing, or is eliminated from the game
 completely.

The particular goal of the game is determined before play begins; examples include capture the flag and elimination.
 Paintball has spawned popular variants, including woodsball, which is played in the natural environment and spans across a large area.
 Conversely, the variant of speedball is played on a smaller field and has a very fast pace with games as brief as two minutes fifteen 
 seconds in the (NSL) or lasting up to twenty minutes in the PSP (Paintball Sports Promotions).
Another variant is scenario paintball, in which players attempt to recreate historical, or fictional settings.</i></P>

<h1><u>Tournaments</h1></u>
<P><I>Tournaments are skill based competitions. These are often bracket tournaments with 5 person teams, taking place on Speedball
 (paintballfields. Tournaments such as the NXL hold different events throughout the summer months all over the United States 
 with a range of skill divisions. Other series such as the Ultimate Woodsball League (UWL) play tournaments with large teams
 on large wooded fields. 
The types of tournaments and applicable skill divisions vary wildly to serve the diverse interest of paintball competition (paintball)</I></P>

<h1><u>Speedball</h1></u>
<P><i>Speedball is played in an open field that could be compared to a soccer field, it is flat with a minimum of natural obstacles, and 
sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The first speedball fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into a number of urban-scenario field styles with larger building-like obstacles for casual play, but speedball itself progressed to using smaller obstacles made from plastic drainage pipe, which offered a more variable field layout and some "give" to the obstacles for increased safety.
 This style of play was often referred to as "Hyperball". Eventually, inflatable fabric "bunkers" were developed based on common 
 obstacle shapes from previous fields, such as "snake" and "can" bunkers. Often referred to as "Airball", the use of these inflatable 
 obstacles both increases player safety by reducing potential injury from collisions with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved 
 to reconfigure the field or to set up temporary fields.</i></P>
 
 <h1><u>woodsball</h1></u>
 <P><i>Woodsball, or "Bushball", is a fairly recent term that refers to what was the original form of the game teams competing in a wooded or
 natural environment, in which varying amounts of stealth and concealment tactics can offer an advantage. 
 The term is commonly used as a synonym for specialized scenario-based play, but it technically refers to virtually any form of 
 paintball played in fields primarily composed of natural terrain and cover such as trees and berms, instead of manmade obstacles.
 Usually the gamemode is team death match although some times it is capture the flag, or protect the president 
 (where one player is chosen as the "president", the president's team must protect the president, the enemy team must
 eliminate the president).</i></P>

<h1><u>Scenario</h1></u>
<P><i>Scenario paintball
Commonly referred to as "Big Games" or "Scenario Games". "Big Games" refer to territory control based gameplay, while a
 "Paintball Scenario" refers to a game where tasks are given to each side at timed intervals. Pioneered by Wayne Dollack, 
 "Scenario Paintball" focus much more heavily on Live Action Roleplaying events, elevating their immersion, storyline, and game 
 play mechanics above the paintball aspect of play. Many variations and combinations of these games are currently played and are
 unique to each event and event producer.
 The game uses the entire venue it is at, combining all normal gaming fields into 1 large playing area. Popular examples of the 
 scenario format are Paintball's Grand Finale at Wayne's World (Ocala, Florida), Cousin's Big Game in Coram, New York (on Long Island), 
  Hell Survivor's Monster Game (just outside Pinckney, Michigan), Invasion of Normandy at Skirmish U.S.A in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma D-Day
(in Wyandotte, Oklahoma), Fight For Asylum at PRZ Paintball (Picton, Ontario), Battle Royale at Flag Raiders Paintball 
(Kitchener, Ontario), the Sherwood Classic at Sherwood Forest (La Porte, Indiana), and Free Finale at Low Country Paintball (Ludowici, GA) events which draws in 100 to 5000 players and run at least 6 hours of uninterrupted play, most often averaging 12 hours of play in 2 days.
"True24" scenario events run at least 24 hours continuously, the most recent one taking place in May 2019 at Sherwood Forest. 
These formats vary widely and are frequently historical MilSim, movie, or pop culture themed.</i></P>


<h1><u>MilSim</h1></u>
<P><i>MilSim ("Military Simulation") is a mode of play designed to create an experience closer to military reality,
 where the attainment of specific objectives is the most important aspect of the game.

MilSim addresses the logistics of combat, mission planning and execution, and dealing with limited resources and ammunition.
 Players are typically eliminated fr
 om the game when struck by paint just like in any traditional game of paintball.
 MilSim is a popular gamemode also played in Airsoft, which is a similar sport to paintball.
With the advent of shaped projectiles, such as the First Strike, and the resulting development of magazine fed markers, 
a considerable increase in range, accuracy and MILSIM  realism was gained.
 Functionally speaking, magazine-fed markers are no different from any other paintball marker, with one exception. 
 Instead of paintballs being gravity fed from a bulky hopper, which sits above the marker, shaped projectiles (or paintballs) are fed from a spring-loaded magazine from the bottom of the marker. 
The caliber of both the gravity fed and magazine fed markers are the same (.68 caliber) and the velocities are also generally the same. 
The increased range and accuracy of the shaped projectile comes from the higher ballistic coefficient that the shaped projectile has, 
and the gyroscopic spin imparted onto the projectile from a rifled barrel and fins on the projectile itself. 
Magazine fed markers and shaped projectiles have allowed marker designs to more closely approximate the styling and 
functionality of actual (real steel) firearms, which in turn has given paintball a better avenue to compete with Airsoft in the 
MilSiM environment.</i></P>

<h1><u>Zombie Hunt</h1></u>
<P><i>A static (or mobile) entertainment attraction. Venue staff are padded up and dressed as zombies. Paintball markers are mounted to a
 flat bed trailer. 
Participants are taken on a "Haunted Hay Ride" style attraction, towed through the property, where they defend themselves from the 
zombie hordes with paintballs. 
Generally, black lights and glow in the dark paintballs.
